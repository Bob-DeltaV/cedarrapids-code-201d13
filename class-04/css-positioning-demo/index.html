        We can move elements by declaring their left, right, top, or bottom
        position. CSS properties such as static, relative, absolute, and fixed
        will determine how the other rules are applied.

      <section>
        <h2>Section here</h2>
        <p>
          This section tag with a red border uses the default value position
          static. See what happens to the absolute elements if you change thie
          section tag to position relative.
        </p>
        <article id="one">
          <h3>Position: relative</h3>
          <p>
            It will display exactly the same as before until you also asign its
            position using: left, right, top, or bottom. This will position it
            that distance relative to its original position.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article id="two">
          <h3>Position Absolute</h3>
          <p>
            This element displays relative to its most recent parent element
            with positioning set. If it has no positioned parent, it will
            display relative to the the page window.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article id="four">
          <h3>Help!</h3>
          <p>
            I am also positioned: absolute. The fixed element is blocking me.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article id="three">
          <h3>Position: Fixed</h3>
          <p>
            This will position the element relative to the viewport. It will
            stay in the same place even if the page scrolls, be careful! It can
            block content on your page unless you account for it by adding
            padding or margin to other elements. See the div asking for help?
            Adjust the size of the browser and you will see some cases where
            that div is completely hidden by this fixed element.
